# One-Click-WSL
One Click WSL setup on Windows 10

## Why

I made this script for myself and decided to share. 

I don't plan on making it more user friendly but feel free to create issue if I have time I'll fix them.

## Documentation

This script basically does what is documented here:

https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10

## Warning

This is not polished.

I'm a stranger on the internet asking you execute privileged code on your machine.

Please check the script and make sure you understand what it does, or at least read the Microsoft documentation.
